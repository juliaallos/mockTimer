## What is Mock Trial
Mock Trial is an extracurricular activity where students dive deep into a fictional court case, preparing to act as attorneys and witnesses while practicing legal procedures, public speaking, and critical thinking.

## Purpose of this Project
In Mock Trial, different parts of the trial have time limits. Rather than using stopwatches where the times are easy to mess up or get confused, I wanted to create code that would allow members of the team to more easily time their materials in competition/practices
